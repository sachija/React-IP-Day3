      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <h2> Que-4 Difference between Axios and Fetch</h2>
      <p>Axios has url in request object. <br>	
Axios is a stand-alone third party package that can be easily installed.	<br>
Axios enjoys built-in XSRF protection.	<br>
Axios uses the data property.	<br>
Axios’ data contains the object  <br>	
Axios request is ok when status is 200 and statusText is ‘OK’.	<br>
Axios performs automatic transforms of JSON data. <br>	
Axios allows cancelling request and request timeout.	</p>

<p>Fetch has no url in request object. <br />Fetch is built into most modern browsers; no installation is required as such. <br>
Fetch does not. <br /> Fetch uses the body property. <br />Fetch’s body has to be stringified. <br />Fetch request is ok when response object contains the ok property. <br />Fetch is a two-step process when handling JSON data- first, to make the actual request; second, to call the .json() method on the response.
  <br />Fetch does not.
